# Heart_Disease
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that will detect if a patient has heart disease or not.
Attached to this project is a Powerpoint Presentation. This presentation is a demo report addressed to the CEO of the heart disease company. The report contains, the insights I gained from analysing the hospital's data, the results of the machine learning models I used and, a feature engineering summary of the most important tests to carryout on a patient in order to determine their true heart condition.
